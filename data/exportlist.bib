In Sao Paulo, the dynamics of land uses and the reconfiguration of areas by real estate market have proved themselves as the main force of production of urban spaces. This holds true even though urban instruments for the induction of city development, articulated by the regulation of municipal public powers, exist. An intensive and prioritary production of urban space by two real estate entrepreneurs has been observed in the city of Sao Paulo. It reveals itself as, generally, separated from projects and plans that could induce the creation of a planned and synergic urban space. Operacoes Urbanas (OU) and Opera foes Urbanas Consorciadas (OUC) that hypothetically should produce an articulation between public and private interests in the production of a fair and equal city. This article presents a critical analysis of such an operation, OUC Vila Leopoldina - Jaguare, that though presented as a possibility for the transformation of a perimeter through urban planning and projects, was never legally regulated giving opportunity to an occupation exclusively driven by real estate projects.},

It has been under human manipulations for more than 30 years. Five major habitats (desert, reclaimed, cultivated, urban and wet) subdivided into 13 minor ones were recognized. Alterations of soil characters by anthropogenic activities of the natural environment for agriculture production have provided a favorable condition for the growth of weedy species. 231 species related to 152 genera and 45 families were recorded; of which 135 species annuals (58.4 %) and 96 perennials (41.5 %). Regarding chorological analysis, Saharo-Arabian attained the maximum value of 23.5 % in Sf, followed by Sudano-Zambezian 20.0 % in Wl, Cosmopolitan (16.6 %), Irano-Turanian 11.8 % in each of Hw and Ic, After the application of TWINSPAN classification technique, five vegetation types were identified, and well segregated along the DCA axis one; which reflects the soil moisture, fertility, biotic change, aridity and species diversity gradients. When soil moisture decreases, species diversity increase. It also represents the gradient of human interference, where the full man-made vegetation (wet lands and cultivated lands) occupied the left end of this gradient, where the less disturbed vegetation (reclaimed and urban land) was in the middle and no man-made vegetation (desert land) was in the right end. This gradient is associated with the increase of the relative presence of aridity.},

   abstract = {Urbanisation is occurring at an unprecedented scale worldwide, with developing countries claiming the biggest share. Developing countries are increasingly facing enormous pressures to manage their urban and rural areas challenged by limited resources, exploding numbers of population and rising expectations for a higher quality of life. Sustainability is central to the management of existing and newly developed areas. It can offer a comprehensive discourse for understanding the functioning of cities and their hinterlands, with an aim to achieve a balance between environmental, economic and social issues for current and future generations. Managing the urbanization of newly developed areas requires innovative thinking and an ability to predict and evaluate the impacts of possible futures. As the new map of Egypt is redrawn and much hope lies on the development of its deserts constituting 95% of the total land area, an efficient process of directing and facilitating urban development is urgently required. This paper presents an Urban Sustainable Management System (USMS) using the process of Integrated Assessment to assess three possible development scenarios based on different economic bases for new developments on desert reclaimed land. Indicators of a quantitative and qualitative nature are used to describe environmental, social and economic capitals of three scenarios as well as setting targets towards the aim of sustainability. Pressure points hindering the sustainable development of reclaimed land are drawn under the three different scenarios. The USMS provides an urban management system that overcomes difficulties of data availability, combines interdisciplinary knowledge and deals with uncertainties of future developments; struggles decisionmakers confront across the divide but more so in developing countries.

   abstract = {Indoor particulate matter samples were collected in 17 homes in an urban area in Alexandria during the summer season. During air measurement in all selected homes, parallel outdoor air samples were taken in the balconies of the domestic residences. It was found that the mean indoor PM2.5 and PM10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 2.5 and 10 m, respectively) concentrations were 53.5 +/- 15.2 and 77.2 +/- 15.1 mu g/m(3), respectively. The corresponding mean outdoor levels were 66.2 +/- 16.5 and 123.8 +/- 32.1 mu g/m(3), respectively. PM2.5 concentrations accounted, on average, for 68.8 +/- 12.8% of the total PM10 concentrations indoors, whereas PM2.5 contributed to 53.7 +/- 4.9% of the total outdoor PM10 concentrations. The median indoor/outdoor mass concentration (I/O) ratios were 0.81 (range: 0.43-1.45) and 0.65 (range: 0.4-1.07) for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. Only four homes were found with I/O ratios above 1, indicating significant contribution from indoor sources. Poor correlation was seen between the indoor PM10 and PM2.5 levels and the corresponding outdoor concentrations. PM10 levels were significantly correlated with PM2.5 loadings indoors and outdoors and this might be related to PM10 and PM2.5 originating from similar particulate matter emission sources. Smoking, cooking using gas stoves, and cleaning were the major indoor sources contributed to elevated indoor levels of PM10 and PM2.5. Implications: The current study presents results of the first PM2.5 and PM10 study in homes located in the city of Alexandria, Egypt. Scarce data are available on indoor air quality in Egypt. Poor correlation was seen between the indoor and outdoor particulate matter concentrations. Indoor sources such as smoking, cooking, and cleaning were found to be the major contributors to elevated indoor levels of PM10 and PM2.5.},

   abstract = {Public transportation systems play a significant role in emergency evacuation. Therefore, this paper is geared towards harnessing subway and bus transit to alleviate congestion pressure during evacuation of busy urban areas. Routing and scheduling of transit vehicles and subway operation is envisioned as a new variant of the well-established vehicle routing problem. The model presented in this paper combines multiple variants of the traditional vehicle routing problem while reflecting on the operational characteristics during emergency evacuation, to include (1) multiple depots to better distribute the transit fleet, (2) time constraints to account for the evacuation time window, and (3) constraints for pick-up and delivery locations of evacuees. The evacuation problem is hereafter defined as a multi-depot time-constrained pick-up delivery vehicle route problem. A framework, using constraint programming and local search methods, was developed to model and solve the problem. An optimal spatio-temporal evacuation model was performed first to optimize evacuation of background vehicular traffic, generating transit travel cost (i.e., link travel times) as an input to the evacuation problem. The methodology was applied to evacuate the entire city of Toronto. The results show that the Toronto Transit Commission fleet is capable of evacuating the transit-dependent population (1.34 million) within 2 h on average. The four subway lines of the city of Toronto carry approximately 0.62 million people and can evacuate these people in less than 3 h on average. Toronto Transit Commission shuttle buses (1,320 vehicles) can evacuate the remainder of the transit-dependent population (0.72 million) in approximately 1.5 h on average.

   abstract = {The utility of crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) in reducing crime and increasing social cohesion has found broad theoretical support, but the multivariate relationships of CPTED have not been fully explored empirically. Although there are a large number of empirical studies regarding the influence of age on an individual's fear, there have been no empirical studies that focus on the influence of age on CPTED and perceived neighbourhood cohesion. This study investigated the hypothesised relationships between CPTED and perceived neighbourhood cohesion (PNC) in elderly and non-elderly homeowners in a typical neighbourhood in Penang, Malaysia. An observation tool is designed as the survey instrument to assess the level of CPTED, completed by an independent observer. This step was followed by a face-to-face questionnaire survey to examine the residents' PNC. The observation tool is subdivided into four domains to reflect the CPTED dimensions, whereas two scales were used to measure PNC. In all, 294 respondents were involved in this study. The results were validated by employing higher-order Confirmatory Factor Analysis to determine the final PNC and CPTED measurement models. A multigroup analysis using structural equation modelling indicated a significant positive effect of CPTED on both PNC scales for the elderly respondents but not for the non-elderly respondents.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing number of the elderly persons and their attendant health problems has implications on public health programs in developing countries. However, there is limited information on the elderly residing outside major cities in Nigeria. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine and compare prevalent health problems and associated risk factors in the elderly of urban and rural communities in Oyo State, Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional survey of consenting adults aged 60 years and above in Iseyin (urban) and Ilua (rural) communities of Oyo State in south-west, Nigeria. Using cluster sampling technique, a total of 630 respondents; 316 in the urban and 314 in the rural participated. Information was sought on the respondents' socio-demographic characteristics, life style, self-reported health problems. Anthropometric measurements and clinical examination including blood pressure measurements and visual acuity were conducted. RESULTS: The mean age of urban respondents was 72.2 9.5 years compared with 70.8 8.1 years in the rural. There were more females (61.1%) than males (38.9%) in both the locations. Self-reported health problems in both locations were similar and included reduced sexual fulfillment, musculoskeletal problems such as muscular and low back pain. On clinical examination, the main health problems were visual impairment 58.7% in the urban versus 41.7% in the rural ( P < 0.001). Prevalence of hypertension among urban and rural respondents was 38.3% and 34.7%, respectively ( P = 0.35). Osteoarthritis was significantly higher 8.5% in urban than 3.2% obtained in rural ( P = 0.004v). On multivariate analysis, female gender, increasing body mass index, and low monthly income were significant predictors of hypertension in both locations. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and visual noncommunicable diseases were prevalent in both elderly populations. Social conditions and gender play important role in the health status of the elderly.},

Estimation accounts for potential biases due to the endogeneity of density and industrial composition effects. Using new information on output per worker for U.S. metropolitan areas along with a measure of density that accounts for the spatial distribution of population, we find that a doubling of density increases productivity by 24 percent. Consistent with theories of learning and knowledge spillovers in cities, we demonstrate that the elasticity of average labor productivity with respect to density increases with human capital. Metropolitan areas with a human capital stock one standard deviation below the mean realize no productivity gain, while doubling density in metropolitan areas with a human capital stock one standard deviation above the mean yields productivity benefits that are about twice the average. These patterns are particularly pronounced in industries where the exchange of information and sharing of ideas are important parts of the production process.},

It discusses people's perception over time, from pre-rehabilitation expectations to initial impression of the rehabilitation to their opinions of the matured project in a longer term perspective. It is one of the few studies in the UK to include pre-, post- and long-term assessments for the same area. The green environments riverscapes provide, especially in urban spaces, have positive effects on people's well-being and are appreciated as areas for relaxation and recreation. However, the over exploitation of riverscapes has dramatically decreased their function, the ecosystem services they provide and the connection between people and nature. Results from our surveys indicate that with careful design considering both social and ecosystem values, and wider collaboration between science and social science, river rehabilitation works can re-establish riverscapes that provide attractive recreational spaces without losing their possibilities to sustain healthy ecosystems. Ecosystem recovery is a long and time consuming process, but this research shows that it also takes time for people to build up a caring and emotional connection to their local riverscapes. This process can be aided by common vision building and attending to features providing possibilities for recreation and access, and attractive greenery. We conclude that by applying a transparent process for rehabilitation schemes, with a clear social and environmental focus, we increase our chances of providing long-term benefits and receiving public support for enhancing the state of our rivers.

   abstract = {Many historic buildings in old urban centers in Eastern Canada are made of stone masonry reputed to be highly vulnerable to seismic loads. Seismic risk assessment of stone masonry buildings is therefore the first step in the risk mitigation process to provide adequate planning for retrofit and preservation of historical urban centers. This paper focuses on development of analytical displacement-based fragility curves reflecting the characteristics of existing stone masonry buildings in Eastern Canada. The old historic center of Quebec City has been selected as a typical study area. The standard fragility analysis combines the inelastic spectral displacement, a structure-dependent earthquake intensity measure, and the building damage state correlated to the induced building displacement. The proposed procedure consists of a three-step development process: (1) mechanics-based capacity model, (2) displacement-based damage model and (3) seismic demand model. The damage estimation for a uniform hazard scenario of 2% in 50 years probability of exceedance indicates that slight to moderate damage is the most probable damage experienced by these stone masonry buildings. Comparison is also made with fragility curves implicit in the seismic risk assessment tools Hazus and ELER. Hazus shows the highest probability of the occurrence of no to slight damage, whereas the highest probability of extensive and complete damage is predicted with ELER. This comparison shows the importance of the development of fragility curves specific to the generic construction characteristics in the study area and emphasizes the need for critical use of regional risk assessment tools and generated results.},

   abstract = {Beginning from the village monographs, it has not already been mentioned about the insane people, with whom we are able to come across in every village of Anatolia, at almost none of the studies concerning the folk life in rural living spaces. This situation has not been changed even at the studies about the urban culture, which have been processed frequently since the beginning of 1990's. Previously, the identically adaptation efforts of the methods of determination and analysis, which were followed at the studies, related with rural regions, into the oral culture studies of rural spaces, have already been the determinative factor in this aspect. Whereas the insane people and the growing culture around them, belief and the way of thinking have a quite important place, like a great many of facts which have not been noticed up to the present in the district life, where keeps cultural codes of city life in its structure. Besides the determination of the changing or unchanging facts in social perception towards to the people, accepted as "insane" with or without a mental disease, the other hints, gained from the telling narrations, of which place are mostly parts of urban living space, will provide possibility to the researchers of culture to obtain new researching subjects and to get different viewpoints. This study aims to emphasize the necessity to add new headings to the researchers of city culture by Giresun sample via the insane people, living in cities. It is tried to mention about the ways of perception of urban people in the narratives of insane that has got distinctive features by the narratives about themselves in Giresun urban life.},

   abstract = {Chronicle literature in early twentieth-century Rio de Janeiro developed in tandem with the urban modernization that followed the abolition of slavery in 1888. Writers-flaneurs strolled city streets to observe human behavior in the new post-abolition urban environment. The street vendor, a fellow traveler within the city, was quickly identified by chroniclers as an integral component of the modern city. Ruling elites, however, viewed street commerce as a blot on the modern urban landscape and sought to prohibit vending through a series of policies that vendors often contested. Chroniclers and newspapers' embrace of vendors therefore reveals the ambivalence that marked the effort to define modernity. Although connected to the city's slave past, street vendors came to represent a modern urban membership unique to the Brazilian capital. The practice of street commerce and the intellectual culture surrounding it reflects how walking the city carved an alternative urban citizenship and sense of belonging.},

   abstract = {Traffic is the major air pollution source in most urban areas. Nowadays, most of the strategies carried out to improve urban air quality are focused on reducing traffic emissions. Nevertheless, acting locally on urban design can also reduce levels of air pollutants. In this paper, both strategies are studied in several scenarios for a medium-sized town of the Basque Country (Spain). Two main actions are analysed in order to reduce traffic emissions: (1) minor extension of a pre-existing low emission zone (LEZ); (2) substitution of 10% of passenger cars that are older than 5 years by hybrid and electric vehicles. Regarding local urban design, three alternatives for the development of one side of a street canyon are considered: (1) a park with trees; (2) an open space without obstacles; (3) a building. Two different urban traffic dispersion models are used to calculate the air quality scenarios: PROKAS (Gaussian&box) to analyse the reduction of traffic emissions in the whole urban area and WinMISKAM (CFD) to evaluate specific urban designs. The results show the effectiveness of the analysed actions. On one hand, the definition of a small LEZ, as well as the introduction in 2015 of vehicles with new technology (hybrid and electric), results in minor impacts on PM10 and NO2 ambient concentrations. On the other hand, local urban design can cause significant variation in spatial distribution of pollutant concentrations emitted inside street canyons. Consequently, urban planners should consider all these aspects when dealing with urban air pollution control.},

   abstract = {The main purpose of this work is to determine the relative contribution of different types of aerosols at an urban site by using two independent approaches: individual particle analysis, and radiative transfer calculations and irradiance measurements. To accomplish that purpose, we used our UV-B irradiance (280-315 nm) data set, the AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) database, the SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy, LEO 1450VP) analyses of the collected particles and the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model. On one hand, the collected particles were analyzed by SEM-EDX (Energy Dispersive X-Ray, Genesis 2000) in order to determine their chemical composition. Then, by using a developed algorithm they were classified as rural or urban, resulting in a (24 +/- 3)% of rural and (76 +/- 8)% of urban. On the other hand, aerosols were incorporated into the SBDART model through two of its default profiles (urban or rural) and by using the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) provided by AERONET. The aerosol effect on experimental surface UV-B irradiance was reproduced by a linear combination of the irradiances calculated by using these profiles. From this analysis we found that, in average, a mix of aerosols of (30 +/- 3)% rural and (70 +/- 7)% urban explains the observed reduction in the experimental irradiance. Considering the agreement between the results obtained by using these two independent methodologies, the use of the irradiance as a surrogate variable to retrieve aerosol types is discussed. The methodology presented here is applicable to any site provided irradiance measurements and AOD are available. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {A cellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a monstrously large single cell visible by an unaided eye. The slime mold explores space in parallel, is guided by gradients of chemoattractants, and propagates toward sources of nutrients along nearly shortest paths. The slime mold is a living prototype of amorphous biological computers and robotic devices capable of solving a range of tasks of graph optimization and computational geometry. When presented with a distribution of nutrients, the slime mold spans the sources of nutrients with a network of protoplasmic tubes. This protoplasmic network matches a network of major transport routes of a country when configuration of major urban areas is represented by nutrients. A transport route connecting two cities should ideally be a shortest path, and this is usually the case in computer simulations and laboratory experiments with flat substrates. What searching strategies does the slime mold adopt when exploring 3-D terrains? How are optimal and transport routes approximated by protoplasmic tubes? Do the routes built by the slime mold on 3-D terrain match real-world transport routes? To answer these questions, we conducted pioneer laboratory experiments with Nylon terrains of USA and Germany. We used the slime mold to approximate route 20, the longest road in USA, and autobahn 7, the longest national motorway in Europe. We found that slime mold builds longer transport routes on 3-D terrains, compared to flat substrates yet sufficiently approximates man-made transport routes studied. We demonstrate that nutrients placed in destination sites affect performance of slime mold, and show how the mold navigates around elevations. In cellular automaton models of the slime mold, we have shown variability of the protoplasmic routes might depends on physiological states of the slime mold. Results presented will contribute toward development of novel algorithms for sensorial fusion, information processing, and decision making, and will provide inspirations in design of bioinspired amorphous robotic devices.},

   abstract = {dinal ranges are experiencing rising air temperatures compared to their surrounding rural areas. This study investigated how this urban heat island effect (UHIE) may influence the streamflow of rivers crossing large urban areas on annual and multi-decadal time-scales. In order to detect, link, and quantify differences in meteorological and streamflow patterns between rural and large urban areas, this study developed a methodology based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), cross-wavelet transform (XWT), linear regression, as well as the Mann-Kendall (MK) test. A case study was carried out for the city of Ottawa, Canada as the metropolitan centre, along with three surrounding rural locations (Angers, Arnprior, Russell), with pristine rivers crossing these locations. From roughly 1970 to 2000, air temperature in Ottawa increased at a rate exceeding 0.035 degrees C/year, while parallel changes in rural areas were relatively stable, and varied by less than 0.025 degrees C/year. The urban warming that occurred during these decades was accompanied by a significant drop in the amplitude of annual temperatures (i.e. warmer winters). Precipitation in both urban and rural areas showed no significant trends, although the variability in the precipitation amount decreased in both settings. Concurrently, streamflow showed decreasing trends in both urban and rural areas. Annual amplitudes in urban streamflow (Rideau River through Ottawa, ON) correlated positively with annual air temperature amplitudes (i.e., less severe annual flooding with a decreasing winter/summer temperature contrast), whereas such a relationship was not apparent for the rural stations. Moreover, the timing of the annual daily minimum temperature cycle correlated significantly with the streamflow pattern in the urban area, i.e., early annual warming corresponded to earlier annual streamflow maxima. The precipitation pattern (i.e. distribution of rain and snowfall over time) significantly influenced the annual and long term streamflow pattern, but this influence differed little between urban and rural areas. It was also determined that the warming from the urban heat island effect, especially during winter months, was found to perhaps reduce the severity of the annual spring flood event in mid-to-high latitudinal continental settings.

   abstract = {Invasive species are often favoured in fragmented, highly-modified, human-dominated landscapes such as urban areas. Because successful invasive urban adapters can occupy habitat that is quite different from that in their original range, effective management programmes for invasive species in urban areas require an understanding of distribution, habitat and resource requirements at a local scale that is tailored to the fine-scale heterogeneity typical of urban landscapes. The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is one of New Zealand's most destructive invasive pest species. As brushtail possums traditionally occupy forest habitat, control in New Zealand has focussed on rural and forest habitats, and forest fragments in cities. However, as successful urban adapters, possums may be occupying a wider range of habitats. Here we use site occupancy methods to determine the distribution of brushtail possums across five distinguishable urban habitat types during summer, which is when possums have the greatest impacts on breeding birds. We collected data on possum presence/absence and habitat characteristics, including possible sources of supplementary food (fruit trees, vegetable gardens, compost heaps), and the availability of forest fragments from 150 survey locations. Predictive distribution models constructed using the programme PRESENCE revealed that while occupancy rates were highest in forest fragments, possums were still present across a large proportion of residential habitat with occupancy decreasing as housing density increased and green cover decreased. The presence of supplementary food sources was important in predicting possum occupancy, which may reflect the high nutritional value of these food types. Additionally, occupancy decreased as the proportion of forest fragment decreased, indicating the importance of forest fragments in determining possum distribution. Control operations to protect native birds from possum predation in cities should include well-vegetated residential areas; these modified habitats not only support possums but provide a source for reinvasion of fragments.},

Tracing the contingent path-dependencies of transportation crises highlights tensions between, and within, preexisting metropolitan dynamics and an ascendant neoliberal city-regionalism. The mobilization of collective regional agency appears necessary to overcome the inertia of divisive metropolitan politics, yet the specific political-economic contexts of the case city-regions significantly condition the structural capacity of actors producing, and the potential articulation of, emergent city-regional governance.},

   abstract = {A significant reduction in maternal mortality was witnessed globally in the year 2010, yet, no significant reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Nigeria was recorded. The absence of accurate data on the numbers, causes and local factors influencing adverse maternal outcomes has been identified as a major obstacle hindering appropriate distribution of resources targeted towards improving maternal healthcare. This paper reports the first community based study that measures the incidence of maternal mortality in Ibadan, Nigeria using the indirect sisterhood method and explores the applicability of this method in a community where maternal mortality is not a rare event. A community-based study was conducted in Ibadan using the principles of the sisterhood method developed by Graham et al. for developing countries. Using a multi-stage sampling design with stratification and clustering, 3,028 households were selected. All persons approached agreed to take part in the study (a participation rate of 100%), with 2,877 respondents eligible for analysis. There was a high incidence of maternal mortality in the study setting: 1,324/6,519 (20.3%) sisters of the respondents had died, with 1,139 deaths reportedly related to pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium. The MMR was 7,778 per 100,000 live births (95% CI 7,326-8,229). Adjusted for a published Total Fertility Rate of 6.0, the MMR was 6,525 per 100,000 live births (95% CI 6,144-6,909). Women in Ibadan were dying more from pregnancy related complications than from other causes. Findings of this study have implications for midwifery education, training and practice and for the first time provide policy makers and planners with information on maternal mortality in the community of Ibadan city and shed light on the causes of maternal mortality in the area.},

   abstract = {This paper examines vulnerability to recent occurrences of wind hazards in the context of changing patterns of urbanization, land use, land cover and wind climate in Ibadan, the largest traditional urban centre in sub-Saharan Africa. The period 1989-2008 shows a significant increase in maximum wind gusts, with the latter half of the period, 1998-2008, recording higher mean maximum wind gusts and more frequent windstorms with peak gusts of 48 knots or more. Following a major windstorm event in March 2008, an assessment of the windstorm-induced damage and the vulnerability characteristics of residents of 69 wind-damaged houses in eight districts located in Ibadan's high density core area and older suburbs was undertaken. This was based largely on primary data from interviews conducted with residents of windstorm-affected districts and with key informants in urban planning institutions. The study provides insights into changing climate risk patterns and emerging vulnerabilities of inner-city residents of Ibadan. The role of local institutions in shaping vulnerability to climate risks was also examined.},

This paper attunes to the close and expressive substances that make up immersion in a material-affective ecology of a place, the qualities of the city that seep and imbue its material and biological fabric with affect. There is a growing body of work and literature to aid us from traditions in continental aesthetic theory, French urban sociology and architecture, and an emergent cultural geographic field of atmospheric enquiry. The paper develops such an approach to megacity air in three main ways. First, air tells us about difference. In the testimony of pollutants and choking effluvium, an analysis of air reveals who belongs and who does not, who is deserving and who is not in a constellation of megacity inequality. The atmosphere puts the megacity apart from other urban and political forms. Second, closely related to the issues that circulate around a geopolitics of verticality and the technocratic security concerns of volumetric conceptions of territory, air/atmospheres constitute an environmental ecology of security threats and crisis that thwart megacity life and justify environmental policies as security' (see Zeiderman, 2013). Third, the paper argues how megacities are increasingly productive of secessionary atmospheres, often by removal and exclusion, which are not entirely separate from other atmospheric security concerns.},

   abstract = {Global urban development is currently characterized by varied combination of metropolitan growth and urban core shrinkage. Although much of the shrinkage is concentrated in central cities, first suburbs are now facing the same problem. In this article, Warren, the oldest first suburb of Detroit, is examined as a case study of a shrinking city facing a crisis of economic downturn, automotive restructuring, high unemployment and real-estate foreclosures. Within this context of foreclosure crisis, the research questions are as follows: How existing agencies and institutions (such as local governments, community organizations, business groups and schools) might work at the neighborhood, city or regional level to address foreclosures? How it might help or reduce foreclosures? How can we reuse and revitalize foreclosed properties and abandoned lands? And what specific lessons can be learned that might be applicable in other cities? These questions are specifically explored through documentation and analysis of existing resources and current efforts in Warren. The empirical methodology reveals Warren's attempt to develop planning strategies, culturally based initiatives, community design projects and creative partnerships in the region in order to address challenges of shrinkage and foreclosures at multiple scales. The Warren case study illustrates opportunities for flexible policies combining rightsizing, shared maintenance and incremental development in struggling first suburban communities, which are less studied and often ignored.

On the basis of a study in Dakar, the capital city of Senegal, this article analyses the complexity of the individual and collective issues involved in responses to unintended pregnancy, showing that this notion speaks to a broader reflection on the question of contraception at the start of sexual life. The study is based on 74 life story interviews (49 with women, 25 with men) conducted between 2007 and 2008 in the framework of ECAF (Emergency Contraception in Africa), a research programme funded by the European Union. Data were collected by means of a qualitative biographical approach that provides a overall view of individuals' residential, educational, occupational, affective and/or conjugal trajectories and contraceptive histories. Attitudes to motherhood are found to be structured by four dimensions: the social legitimacy of the relationship in which the pregnancy occurs, power relations among the various protagonists (individuals, couples, families and/or social circle), gender-based power relations, and increasingly precarious living conditions.},

   abstract = {With increasing urbanization today, the negative impact it has on its surroundings is prevalent in many cities and urban areas. Coupled with the need to create and develop sustainable urban developments, it is essential to understand how much the environment as well as its surrounding morphology affects the built environment. Greater emphasis should therefore be placed on urban planning which takes into consideration the surrounding environment and any accompanying effects it might have on the built environment. The integration of design tools with microclimate assessment tools therefore attest to be one with a promising future. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the building performance of offices in Singapore whilst taking into account its surrounding morphology using GIS as a platform for integration with an urban climatic assessment tool. Hourly weather data which accounts for the urban morphology (input to the model) is obtained by morphing maximum, minimum and average temperature (the output of air prediction model STEVE) into a typical 24 h profile. Good agreement was found between predicted dry-bulb temperatures and measured data. A total of two indicators of envelope performance were used and they are (1) increase in conduction (wall, window and roof) heat gain and (2) solar heat gain through glazing taking into account shading by surrounding buildings and morphology. The model was shown to have good agreement with building energy simulation programme IES-VE (c). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A field survey was conducted in two urban slums in the Asawase constituency of Kumasi, Ghana to ascertain the extent of "improved" water and sanitation coverage as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. The study revealed adequate levels of improved water coverage, but both communities had extremely low coverage for improved sanitation (toilet) facilities within the households and most people depended on a very inadequate number of poorly maintained public toilets. Waste management practices in the two communities were also very poor. Findings from this study can be used by city authorities in planning effective sanitation intervention strategies for the communities.},

This study aims to investigate interactions/relationships between the needs, demands and expectations of Turkish elderly and inclusive urban design principles. It tries to answer the research question: how the inclusive urban life could improve elderly life and contribute to achieve an active aging process. An exploratory study was conducted with a total of 100 randomly selected elderly between the ages 65-95 (45 female and 55 male) from the City Centre of Ankara. A survey instrument based on the 'streets for life' concept (Burton & Mitchell 2006) was developed to gather data. The participants were asked to identify how important inclusive urban design features were in understanding, using and navigating within an urban environment. The findings of the study suggest that an inclusive open environment allows elderly people to feel safer, and thus encourage more regular use of urban space. Overall the results highlight two important insights, first that accessibility is inevitable for increasing the chance of the aging population to participate in the mainstream of community life and second, plain and simple signage is necessary to achieve more liveable urban environments. The study concludes the most important physical requirements and social requirements for elderly people.},

We used data from the National Hospitalization Information System to conduct an interrupted time-series analysis for 5 cities in Brazil that had good data quality and high PCV10 vaccination coverage. Of the 197,975 hospitalizations analyzed, 30% were for pneumonia. Significant declines in hospitalizations for pneumonia were noted in Belo Horizonte (28.7%), Curitiba (23.3%), and Recife (27.4%) but not in Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre. However, in the latter 2 cities, vaccination coverage was less than that in the former 3. Overall, 1 year after introduction of PCV10, hospitalizations of children for pneumonia were reduced.},

Their plans provide insights into the potential for strategically bundling long-term development policymaking with the climate agenda. In this article I study the case of Delhi, the first city in India to adopt a climate change action plan. Drawing on the literature on urban ecological security, I examine: (1) the adaptation challenges that Delhi faces; (2) the multiple motivations that underlie early action; (3) the key actors, strategies, and associated action domains outlined in the plan; and (4) the extent to which the plan seeks to bring about systemic change. Proactive action at the city level serves multiple strategic goals. Delhi's case is significant in illustrating how it has leveraged emergent opportunities to advance its short-term development agenda, given the tight fiscal constraints and governance challenges it faces. The plan has been strategically formulated to enhance competiveness, facilitate image-building, garner support for pet projects and access alternative sources of funding. But the short-term orientation of the plan and its limited mechanisms for citizen engagement have severely restrained its capacity to address underlying social vulnerabilities or bring about transformative change.},

How are the lanes enforced? To answer these questions, the study developed detailed cases on management strategies in seven cities that currently have shared-use bus priority lanes: Los Angeles, London, New York City, Paris, San Francisco, Seoul, and Sydney.

   abstract = {This paper presents a new method to establish a ranking of nodes in an urban network. In the original PageRank algorithm, a single PageRank vector is computed to determine the relative importance of Web pages, independent of any particular search query. We follow a similar reasoning, adapting the concept of PageRank vector to urban networks. We translate an urban network to graph theory language, where the nodes represent crossings or squares and the edges represent the connections between nodes. In this scenario, our main goal is to establish a ranking of importance of the different nodes in the graph. Unlike the PageRank model which only takes into account the connections between the Web pages, in our method we must consider other external factors to carry out the classification. These external factors may have some characteristics associated with the nodes and they are different according to the problem we are working. These characteristics are usually related to the presence of some facilities or endowments in the nodes of the network, like for example the presence of restaurants, bars, shopping centers, stores, and so on. A data matrix will collect the quantification of each of the characteristics studied for each node and will play an important role in the process of classification. Considering the influence of all these characteristics, we construct a matrix with some interesting algebraic features which allow us to compute an eigenvector associated to the dominant eigenvalue lambda = 1. This vector constitutes the solution to our problem of ranking the nodes of the network. The model is applied to a real example, in which we consider a part (the old town) of the city of Murcia (Spain). For this example, we apply the PageRank model, as well as the proposed model in this paper, in order to perform a comparative study of both models. This example clearly shows the importance of considering external factors to quantify the urban network nodes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The UHA helps to structure large influences of urban context on water and other resource cycles as an aid to urban planners and water managers in designing sustainable urban areas.},

The focus is on informal settlements in the Magdalena Contreras Delegation, a peripheral municipality where the research team applied 719 questionnaires to the inhabitants. The results offer an up-to-date socio-economic analysis of the population. We are also in a position to suggest answers to the following questions: to what extent communal lands with a high ecological value act as territorial reserves for irregular settlements?; how do poverty levels in these settlements affect the consolidation process in terms of housing quality and access to public services?; how much heterogeneity is there inside irregular settlements and what is the level of poverty in these settlements and how grave is the situation?},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a three-tier process for supporting policy planning of urban agroecosystems. It comprises the following steps: (i) definition of the agro-environmental unit; (ii) measurement of the non-market values; (iii) estimation of opportunity cost. An application to an urban wetland agro-ecosystem within Mexico City is used for illustrating our methodology. We estimated that the wetland agro-ecosystem has a lower-bound monetary value between $15.6 million and $31.5 million USD/ha/y. As the land conversion rate is about 3.73 ha/y, the opportunity cost would be between $22,300 and $44,900 USD/ha/y. Such figures are an objective way to appreciate both the potential enhancement value and the opportunity cost of ecosystem services adjacent to urban areas, providing both urban and environmental policy guidance. We argue that this framework allows for multi-scale analysis and may be applied for other urban ecosystems as well. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Objectives. Alcohol outlet density has long been associated with alcohol-related harms, and policymakers have endorsed alcohol outlet restriction to reduce these harms. However, potential nonlinearity in the relation between outlet density and alcohol consumption has not been rigorously examined. Methods. We used data from the New York Social Environment Study (n = 4000) to examine the shape of the relation between neighborhood alcohol outlet density and binge drinking by using a generalized additive model with locally weighted scatterplot smoothing, and applied an imputation-based marginal modeling approach. Results. We found a nonlinear relation between alcohol outlet density and binge drinking; the association was stronger at densities of more than 80 outlets per square mile. Binge drinking prevalence was estimated to be 13% at 130 outlets, 8% at 80 outlets, and 8% at 20 outlets per square mile. Conclusions. This nonlinearity suggests that reductions in alcohol outlet density where density is highest and the association is strongest may have the largest public health impact per unit reduction. Future research should assess the impact of policies and interventions that aim to reduce alcohol outlet density, and consider nonlinearity in effects.},

   abstract = {The impacts of urbanization on hydrology and water quality can be minimized with the use of low impact development (LID) practices in urban areas. This study assessed the performance of rain barrel/cistern and porous pavement as retrofitting technologies in two urbanized watersheds of 70 and 40 km(2) near Indianapolis, Indiana. Six scenarios consisting of the watershed existing condition, 25% and 50% implementation of rain barrel/cistern and porous pavement, and 25% rain barrel/cistern combined with 25% porous pavement were evaluated using a proposed LID modeling framework and the Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment (L-THIA)-LID model. The model was calibrated for annual runoff from 1991 to 2000, and validated from 2001 to 2010 for the two watersheds. For the calibration period, R-2 and NSE values were greater than 0.60 and 0.50 for annual runoff and streamflow. Baseflow was not calibrated in this study. During the validation period, R-2 and NSE values were greater than 0.50 for runoff and streamflow, and 0.30 for baseflow in the two watersheds. The various application levels of barrel/cistern and porous pavement resulted in 2-12% reduction in runoff and pollutant loads for the two watersheds. Baseflow loads slightly increased with increase in baseflow by more than 1%. However, reduction in runoff led to reduction in total streamflow and associated pollutant loads by 1-9% in the watersheds. The results also indicate that the application of 50% rain barrel/cistern, 50% porous pavement and 25% rain barrel/cistern combined with 25% porous pavement are good retrofitting options in these watersheds. The L-THIA-LID model can be used to inform management and decision-making for implementation of LID practices at the watershed scale. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Because competition theoretically results in lower prices and improved service, water consumers will subsequently reap the benefits. There is, however, little documentation supporting this claim in practice. Based on field research in Maputo, Mozambique in 2009, we analyze the degree and nature of competition between these providers. We show that the idea of 'healthy competition' with 'free market entry' is an oversimplification of the function of the market, and in particular the complexities of service provision in this specific sector. Given the inequities between providers, the case demonstrates that the theory behind private sector incentives has little empirical value for improving affordable and high quality water provision.

Although ad hoc measures recognising small-scale providers as a temporary alternative to service provision by a formal utility have been implemented, these measures appear designed to increase control over these providers rather than support the service delivery capacity of small-scale providers.},

This study aimed to examine the influence of neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) and formality status on self-rated health (SRH) of adult men and women residing in formal and informal urban neighbourhoods in Aleppo. Methods: The study used data from 2038 survey respondents to the Aleppo Household Survey, 2004 (age 18-65 years, 54.8% women, response rate 86%). Respondents were nested in 45 neighbourhoods.

Multilevel regression models were used to investigate associations. Results: We did not find evidence of important SRH variation between neighbourhoods. Neighbourhood average of household item ownership was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting excellent SRH in women; odds ratio (OR) for an increase of one item on average was 2.3 (95% CI 1.3-4.4 (versus poor SRH)) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.5 (versus normal SRH)), adjusted for individual characteristics and neighbourhood formality.

   abstract = {This study estimates quantitative and qualitative demand for housing using household survey data in Delhi. Both housing demand and demand for housing attributes are further stratified by settlement type slum and non-slum, and by tenure - owner and renter. The estimation results indicate that housing demand is inelastic with respect to price and income, whereas the magnitude of price elasticity is overall smaller than that of income elasticity in absolute term. In slum households, however, price elasticity is larger than income elasticity. The estimates of housing attributes also show that floor area, availability of a separate kitchen, permanent material of roof, independent latrine, drainage, and flat type of dwelling structure, among others, are important determinants of rent. In slum households, however, only quantity variables matter while quality variables have little effect on rent. This study concludes with policy prescriptions including sufficient urban land supply, which is required to cope with income growth of non-slum households on one hand and to provide low cost dwelling for slum household on the other hand.

There is paucity of data about the molecular basis of ADH among ethnic groups other than those of European or Japanese descent. Here, we examined the molecular basis of ADH in a multiethnic patient cohort from lipid clinics in a large, urban US city. Methods and Results-A total of 38 men and 53 women, aged 22 to 76 years, met modified Simon-Broome criteria for ADH and were screened for mutations in the exons and consensus splice sites of LDLR, and in selected exons of apolipoprotein B-100 and proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9. Deletions and duplications of LDLR exons were detected with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Heterozygous variants in LDLR were identified in 30 patients and in apolipoprotein B-100 in 1 patient. The remaining 60 patients (65%) had unexplained ADH. A higher proportion of blacks (77%) than either non-Hispanic whites (57%) or Hispanics (53%) had unexplained ADH. Compared with patients with LDLR variants, those with unexplained ADH had lower levels of LDL-cholesterol (292 +/- 47 mg/dL versus 239 +/- 42 mg/dL, respectively; P<0.0001) and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (45 +/- 12 mg/dL versus 54 +/- 13 mg/dL, respectively; P=0.003). Conclusions-Our findings suggest that additional loci may contribute to ADH, especially in understudied populations such as blacks. (Circ Cardiovasc Genet. 2012;5:666-675.)},

In this model, most of the attention is paid to the moisture and thermal characteristics of rainstorms in the region. In order to achieve the objective of the study, eight intensive and widespread storms that lasted one to four days were selected. The results showed that the intensive rainstorms of the basin are intensified by the merging of Mediterranean cyclones with Sudan lows. Through the largest rainstorms, the PMP of the basin was computed as 102 mm. The results from the study are the main input for the calculation of the probable maximum flooding (PMF) of the basin.},

   abstract = {We report findings from a mixed method study of women's gendered experiences with flash floods in the coastal city of Lagos, Nigeria. Drawing on narrative accounts from 36 interviews, a survey (n = 453) and 6 focus group discussions, we investigate the impacts of floods in general and specifically the July 2011 flood event on women's lives, livelihoods, and health. We draw on complementary perspectives from feminist political ecology and social vulnerability theory to understand the ways in which such events are perceived, experienced and managed by women of different socio-economic classes, households, and geographic locations. Thematic and content analyses were used to examine women's perceptions of floods, while descriptive statistical analysis and chi-square test were employed to compare actual impacts. Results show that women in general expressed no concern about gendered vulnerability to flooding as most believed flood impacts were gender neutral. This dominant view however, was not supported by evidence in the post-July 2011 flooding as impacts varied among income groups and neighbourhoods, and gender differences were apparent. Women in the low-income neighbourhood recorded higher impacts and slower recovery compared to other social categories of women and men. All impacts reported were statistically significant between women in low and high income neighbourhoods but most were not significant between women in middle and high income neighbourhoods. Gender relations and roles intersecting with place, class, employment status, and healthcare, were mediating factors that placed low-income women at greater risk of impacts than others. With climate change likely to induce more extreme events, a case is made for collaborative and institutional efforts to systematically boost urban poor women's adaptive capacity through targeted programmes aimed at alleviating poverty and improving women's access to housing, health care and alternative sources of livelihoods.

   abstract = {Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risks of stroke and death, and the prevalence of AF is increasing significantly. Until recently, warfarin was the only oral anticoagulant for stroke prevention, but novel anticoagulants are now under development. Methods and results: The Fushimi AF Registry is a community-based survey of AF patients. We aimed to enroll all of the AF patients in Fushimi-ku, which is located at the southern end of the city of Kyoto. Fushimi-ku is densely populated with a total population of 283,000, and is assumed to represent a typical urban community in Japan. On the basis of the general prevalence of AF in the Japanese (0.6%), we estimated the total number of AF patients as 1700. A total of 76 institutions, a large proportion of which were private clinics, participated in the study. At present, we have enrolled 3183 patients from March 2011 to June 2012 (approximately 1.12% of total population). The mean age was 74.2 +/- 11.0 years, and 59.3% of subjects were male. The mean body weight was 58.5 +/- 13.2 kg, and the proportions with a body weight of less than 50 kg and 60 kg were 25.7% and 55.0%, respectively. The type of AF was paroxysmal in 46.0%, persistent in 73%, and permanent in 46.7%. Major co-existing diseases were hypertension (60.6%), heart failure (27.9%), diabetes (23.2%), stroke (19.4%), coronary artery disease (15.0%), myocardial infarction (6.4%), dyslipidemia (42.4%), and chronic kidney disease (26.4%). The mean CHADS2 score was 2.09 +/- 1.35: 0 in 11.8% of patients, 1 in 27.1%, and 2 in 29.1%. Warfarin was prescribed in only 48.5% of patients, whereas anti-platelet drugs, mainly aspirin, were prescribed for more than 30% of the patients. Conclusions: The Fushimi AF Registry provides a unique snapshot of current AF management in an urban community in Japan. (C) 2013 Japanese College of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines how declining cities have become key sites for tailored market intervention, focusing on the collapse of Detroit's land market. Long-term decline has been exacerbated by legislative changes orchestrated by think tanks seeking to reinvigorate the market for private property while using homeownership for neighborhood stabilization. Analysis of legislative proceedings, tax foreclosure auction data, and interviews with developers, officials, and activists document the trajectory of these policies of market fundamentalism and indicate that the primary stabilization has involved a revitalization of the conditions for predatory capital accumulation in a declining city.},

In many cities, local governments have introduced policy measures, in particular time-access restrictions, to alleviate these problems. However, setting time windows is very challenging due to the conflicting interests and objectives of the stakeholders involved. In this article, we examine whether it is possible to develop time-window policies that enhance environmental sustainability and distribution efficiencies, while meeting the objectives of the municipalities. We develop a framework for balancing retailer (costs), municipality (satisfaction), and environmental (emissions) objectives, using data envelopment analysis, under different urban time-window policies. The approach is illustrated by a case study of three Dutch retail organizations, with a large number of stores affected by such time windows. On the basis of an evaluation of 99 different time-window policies, our results show that harmonizing time windows between neighboring cities leads to the best overall performance. The currently used time-window policy appears to perform reasonably well, but can be improved on all dimensions. However, harmonizing time-window policies may be difficult to realize in practice.},

This paper therefore attempts to investigate how the new urban concepts, which were introduced by modernization and globalization, caused a conflict of identities and how this has resulted in dividing Riyadh into opposing urban entities. The main challenge in establishing a cohesive urban identity in Riyadh is based on the long-term conflict between traditional forms of urbanism and modern ways of urban development. The paper thus investigates the urban transformation of Riyadh from the beginning of the twentieth century until the present day. The main objective of this historic analysis is to capture the various ways inhabitants have perceived surrounding urban environments and how this has been influencing urban planning activities. The applied methodologies include the evaluation of historic documents, such as official reports and plans.},

   abstract = {Cities in developed countries are increasingly challenged by the advent of a global economy that mandates generating creative images of their cities. Meanwhile, it is argued in this study that globalisation, and its Arabic version of Dubaisation, is affecting the sustainability of cities as distinguished destinations because urban representation is influenced not only by standardised global cliche' but also by standardised local images' that transforms local cultures into contested heritage as it intensifies an official and civic nexus. The paradox is examined in Jordan, specifically the famously branded city of mosaic' Madaba, where the state government is currently competing for attracting international investments and tourism development to achieve neoliberal urban restructuring. Urban heritage representation has been subject to passive dominant official discourse that rests upon orthodox mosaic practices of remote past a praxis that is not necessarily endorsed by civic Ahl elbalad. The local mosaic heritage has hitherto been transformed into a competing culture that fosters heritage dualities and challenges the internal implications of heritage representation with its elevated feelings of alienation, disempowerment, gentrification and socio-cultural exclusion. A theoretical framework has been suggested for an alternative civic-orientated heritage revival that allows reconciliation between the official/civic nexus yet meanwhile stimulates creative urban images and identities. Other insights are also considered in the study.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a cellular automata approach for modeling the dynamics of urban growth. Cities are among the most complex spatial systems and modeling their dynamics of growth using traditional modeling techniques is a challenging task. Cellular automata (CA) have been widely used for modeling urban growth because of their computational simplicity and explicit representation of time and space. CA models are able to generate complex patterns from the interaction of simple components of the system using simple rules. This makes CA suitable for modeling the complexity of urban dynamics of the cities. Integrating GIS tools and remote sensing data with CA has the potential to provide realistic simulation of the future urban growth of cities. The proposed approach is applied to model the growth of the City of Montreal, Quebec over the last three decades. Land use/land cover maps derived from Landsat data acquired in 1975 and 1990 were used to train a CA model which was then used to project the land use in 2005. A comparison of the projected and actual land uses for 2005 (map also derived from Landsat imagery) is presented and discussed.},

This paper illustrates the results of land use/cover change in Halabja obtained by using multi-temporal remotely sensed data from 1986 to 1990. The support vector machine supervised classification technique was used to extract information from satellite data, and post-classification change detection method was employed to detect and monitor land use/cover change. Derived land use/cover maps were further validated by using high resolution images derived from Google earth. The results from this research indicate that the overall accuracy of land cover maps generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data were more than 89%. The urban areas and vegetation classes decreased approximately 58.7% to 40.7% between 1986 and 1990, while bare land increased 25.4%. Also, some changes in urban areas were detected that have already been identified as bombed areas particularly around the main roads of Halabja city.},

   abstract = {As our cities become denser and host larger gathering events, the need for scientific and computational approaches to crowd management increases. Today, our cities must cater to activities and places that involve massive crowds such as the Olympics, large transportation terminals and mega entertainment and shopping centers. The planning challenges for mega events and activities led urban planners to embark on new studies that offer entirely new design approaches for crowd management. This article uses the Hajj project as a case study to illustrate these new approaches. By employing a nontechnical discourse, this article explains software applications for crowd management in three areas: (i) diagnosing problems, (ii) testing designs and (iii) setting operational plans. Collectively, these software tools assisted in creating a new design that facilitated a safe Hajj environment in recent years. The article also discusses the significance of employing on-the-ground assistance to ensure successful planning and design.},

   abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate one aspect of the challenges of participatory planning and development in the Jordanian context focussing on the case of refugee camp-cities. These enclaves of quasi squatter-formal settlements provide valuable insights into the complex and multifaceted process of participation in Jordan. The challenges of urban development within the camps' high-density sub-standard environment are augmented by the lack of clear vision due to the complexity of the regional and international political context. Within this framework, an amalgamation of variables impact attempts towards a transparent and inclusive development project. The paper investigates an innovative participatory project for slums upgrading that was designed to engage the local community in its leadership and decision-making. The project adopted the principles of Good Governance and fostered social inclusion and transparency. As such, this case study offers a rare opportunity to investigate a participatory project that is true to the principles of participation and empowerment within a context that is inexperienced in such approaches. The objective of the paper is to understand the locals' response to a new kind of project that is based on inclusiveness, transparency, and equity. The enquiry shows that local power structures will resist such a project's approach because local elites view themselves as gatekeepers to the community. Different tactics will be used towards controlling the project's decision-making process or thwarting approved projects. The process is highly dynamic as actors change positions and yesterday's allies are tomorrow's foes. Local actors play a variety of roles and they ruminate the culture of exclusion and domination. The Talbiyeh Camp Improvement project represents a case study for democratisation on the micro level and the dynamics of the process indicates that although hailed as a need by locals, a fair transparent process will face serious challenges in a context that is lacking in democratic examples and has layers of non-democratic political and social realities. Time and Authority are important variables for the success of such interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Suburban households living in spacious detached houses and owing multiple cars are often seen as main culprits for negative greenhouse consequences of urban sprawl. Consequently, the effects of sprawl have been mostly studied from the viewpoints of emissions from home energy consumption and private driving. Little attention has been paid to the changes in other consumption. In this paper, urban sprawl is linked to the proliferation of semi-detached and detached housing, described as a low-rise lifestyle, at the expense of apartment house living i.e., high-rise lifestyle. We analyze differences between the low-rise and the high-rise lifestyles and their environmental effects in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, taking into account all consumption activities. Environmental effects are assessed by combining greenhouse gas intensities from a consumption-based environmentally-extended input-output (EE I-O) model with expenditure data. Then these carbon footprints are further elucidated with regression analysis. We find that low-rise lifestyles causes approximately 14% more emissions than high-rise lifestyles. However, the relative contributions of emissions from different sources, whether direct or indirect, are almost equal for both. Furthermore, when controlling the level of expenditure, the differences between the two lifestyles unexpectedly disappear and in certain cases are even reversed. We believe that our consumption-based approach facilitates the understanding of sprawling lifestyles and offers important insights for sustainable policy-design and urban planning.},

   abstract = {This study integrates risk assessment tools for diagnosis of urban areas against seismic disasters (RADIUS) and geographic information system (GIS), hence forth denoted as GBR (GIS based RADIUS). The GBR is applied for seismic damage estimation of city of Kelowna, in the interior of British Columbia, Canada. Ground-shaking intensity in the area was developed utilizing the seismic source zones defined by the Geological Survey of Canada and opinions from the local experts. Building inventories were compiled by aggregating data from municipal databases as well as sidewalk surveys and surveys through Google Maps. The GIS tool came in to be handy to provide a basis for effective decision making and gauge the vulnerable areas. Estimated damage and damage distributions were mapped on a block-by-block (535 km) basis. The assessment revealed that an earthquake scenario of M8.5 in the Cascadia Zone may potentially damage around 58 buildings within the city, causing 12 injuries. Plus, the study showed some damage assessment for the lifelines, for example, road and water pipelines networks. The assessment results further revealed that the city of Kelowna downtown area was expected to suffer the highest amount of damage, which in turn may produce the highest amount of economic loss, because it is the concentration of concrete high-rise buildings and clustered economic activities. Therefore, for good measure, extra meticulous efforts and razor-sharp insight bundled with precise seismic damage estimation (2-3 2-km grids) were conducted for the downtown area to provide guidelines for emergency response. The proposed GBR framework provides a useful tool to quickly assess the expected damages in response to a major seismic event, which can be updated easily during disaster.

   abstract = {Cities in developing countries are confronted with two conflicting problems. On the one hand, there is always an increasing demand for urban services and, on the other hand, the public sector responds poorly to the growing demand for such services. This articleexplores and compares the status of physical and environmental infrastructure and services provided in public and privately developed land and housing projects in Greater Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study made use of primary data gathered from April to June 2008. The findings indicate that although some households and developers are aware of the planning regulations which mandate infrastructure and services, this does not necessarily translate into compliance, particularly in privately developed housing projects. As a result, projects are usually developed with inadequate and unsatisfactory facilities. The analysis revealed that most physical and environmental infrastructure and services are either missing or unsatisfactory. These include narrow roads inconsistent with standard widths, little open space for social activities, few areas for childrens' playgrounds and poor waste management. The factors that explain the relatively low levels of physical environmental conditions in privately developed projects include an absence of inter-agency coordination, corruption, a lack of good governance, and political interference, along with disregard and apathy on the part of developers and buyers towards planning regulations. In the light of these findings, this article proposes stronger enforcement of planning regulations and more consistent monitoring by planning agencies to achieve better planned residential areas in Dhaka.},

   abstract = {Alam and Husband explore the ways in which two policies of central government, in both conception and expression, have operated in such a way as to promote the growth of Islamophobia in Britain. Policies of community cohesion developed in response to the riots in northern British cities in 2001, while the counter-terrorist polices that emerged following the bombings on mainland Britain in 2005 were targeted at Britain's Muslim populations. The rhetoric employed in the public sphere to legitimate these policies had the effect of making Islamic identity salient, and aberrant, in the context of twenty-first-century Britain. The scapegoating of Muslims, as essentially an alien wedge in British society with a deep resistance to entering into the British way of life', was attached to an interpretation of their demographic location in British cities so as to present them as both self-segregating' and living parallel lives'. The emergence of home-grown bombers' resulted in the state maintaining a sense of risk to terrorist assault that fed off and into the existing securitization of urban life, consolidating a policy environment defined by the sense of an essentially permanent state of crisis. These exceptional circumstances permitted a suspension of previously sacrosanct principles of human rights and freedoms. The empirical evidence underpinning this paper reinforces the notion that these policies were mutually contradictory in practice, and that the penetration of social cohesion initiatives by the logics of surveillance resulted in a breakdown of trust between large sections of the British Muslim population and the agents of the state.},

Even if initial attempts have been made to operationalize the concept of resilience, a gap exists between the intense theoretical discussion and the use of resilience thinking in planning practice. On the basis of a discussion of existing attempts that define resilience principles, the authors derive eight principles for urban and regional resilience: diversity, redundancy, flexibility and adaptability, modularity, interdependency, stabilizing and buffering factors, mobility, as well as planning and foresight. Referring to two exploratory studiesthe City and Region of Stockholm (Sweden) and the City and Region of Rostock (Germany)this article aims to explore whether spatial planning already contributes to these principles and so to build resilience. The analysis shows that spatial planning already contributes to urban and regional resilience. Also, the principles, as suggested here, can be used to operationalize the idea of resilience. Prospectively, such principles may support spatial planning to choose adaptation measures and specific objectives and to contribute to urban and regional resilience.},

   abstract = {The molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Brazil is complex and heterogeneous because several subtypes co-circulate with some important regional differences. This study evaluated HIV-1 subtypes amongst pregnant women living in the metropolitan area and in the interior cities from central western Brazil. From June 2008 to June 2010, 86.9% of confirmed cases of HIV-1 infection amongst pregnant women (172 out of 198 cases) were recruited in Goiania/Goias state. The HIV-1 pol gene was sequenced after nested-PCR. HIV-1 subtypes were assigned by REGA, phylogenetic, and bootscan analyses. The median age of participants was 26 years (1541 years range); 58.7% of participants were diagnosed during prenatal care and 51.7% of participants came from >50 interior cities within Goias state. Amongst the 131 HIV-1 pol sequences, 64.9% were subtype B, 13.0% were BF1 recombinant, 11.4% were subtype C, 7.6% were subtype F1, and 2.3% were BC recombinant. According to the HIV-1 diagnosis date (19942010), a significant increase in subtype C and a decrease of BF1 mosaics were observed over time. All subtype C patients lived in interior cities where the highest prevalence of subtype C outside southern Brazil was observed (18.4%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple independent introductions of the Brazilian subtype C clade from the southern/southeastern regions of Brazil. The HIV-1 epidemic in women from central western Brazil infected by the heterosexual route is characterized by an unexpectedly high prevalence of subtype C viruses highly related to those circulating in southern/southeastern Brazil. These findings highlight the importance of molecular surveillance programs outside large metropolitan regions in Brazil. J. Med. Virol. 85:396404, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

It examines the bicycle's liminality by combining approaches from practice theory with Mary Douglas' concept of matter out of place'. Much research on cycling has concentrated on the bicycle in movement, yet in our research, based in four relatively high-cycling English urban areas, a common theme was concern about the bicycle when not in use. Bicycles at rest were perceived as threatened or threatening, risky or at-risk; affected by theft, vandalism, the weather, official and familial disapproval. In the study, we link this to the tenuous place of urban cycling in England; while bicycle ownership is widespread, everyday cycling remains marginalised and this shapes the place of the bicycle resting on city streets, in homes and in workplaces. Bicycles waiting for their owners are often matter out of place'. This is seen within the context of broader motorised landscapes which have made driving easier through locating driving competences in the car itself, while comparable cycling competences remain on the outsidewith the cyclist.},

There has been a series of historical cycles that have witnessed a fluctuating interrelation: from pleasant articulation between nineteenth-century public spaces and railroad infrastructures, going through the controversial coexistence noticed by functionalist urban planning between the two fields, and up to the recent urban integration of obsolete infrastructures. With a culturalist approach, contemporary urban historiography reinterprets these episodes in light of the geomorphologic persistence of infrastructures, despite the variations in their usage cycles. The objective of this article is to tackle those historic units in synchrony, in order to make them interact with the historical context that has allowed a homogeneous cut. Our interpretation is that the determination of those historical units has been impacted by social science paradigms, predominant historiographic patterns and dominant urban principles. They have brought about breaks in the way of approaching spatial relationships between infrastructure and city when creating discontinuities in the production of disciplinary knowledge and in the ways of conceiving the urban. We will attempt to reflect upon those paradigmatic changes and their segmental role in urban historiography.},

From a methodological perspective, the procedure was effective since the regionalized curves enabled saving a significant amount of time in the initial calculation of this parameter.},

Poblano lawmakers embraced Porfirian trends in scientific planning, and their attempts to manage the city according to calculated risks of fire reflected broader concerns with hygiene and the correction of social ills. While engineers and architects defended the law for its ability to prevent chaos, merchants criticized the regulations for hindering commerce. By using the rhetoric of order and progress, opposition groups convinced officials to overturn the law and use municipal funds to establish a professional firefighting brigade. This transition to government-controlled public services was the product of popular mobilization and represented an important step in making Puebla a modern city.},

   abstract = {New Management Information Systems (MIS) are necessary at local level as the main source of wealth creation. Therefore, tools and approaches that provide a full future vision of any organization should be a strategic priority for economic development. In this line, cities are "centers of knowledge and sources of growth and innovation" and integrated urban development policies are necessary. These policies support communication networks and optimize location structures as strategies that provide opportunities for social and democratic participation for the citizens. This paper proposes a theoretical model to measure and evaluate the cities intellectual capital that allows determine what we must take into account to make cities a source of wealth, prosperity, welfare and future growth. Furthermore, local intellectual capital provides a long run vision. Thus, in this paper we develop and explain how to implement a model to estimate intellectual capital in cities. In this sense, our proposal is to provide a model for measuring and managing intellectual capital using socio-economic indicators for cities. These indicators offer a long term picture supported by a comprehensive strategy for those who occupy the local space, infrastructure for implementation and management of the environment for its development.},

In this case, the Haredi community comprises sects and sub-sects, whose communal identity plays a central role in everyday life and spatial organization. The residential preferences of Haredi individuals are strongly influenced by the need to live among friends' that is, other members of the same sub-sect. This article explores the dynamics of residential patterns in two of Jerusalem's Haredi neighbourhoods: Ramat Shlomo, a new neighbourhood on the urban periphery, and Sanhedria, an old yet attractive inner-city neighbourhood. We reveal two segregation mechanisms: the first is top-down determination of residence, found in relatively new neighbourhoods that are planned, built and populated with the intense involvement of community leaders; the second is the bottom-up emergence of residential patterns typical of inner-city neighbourhoods that have gradually developed over time.},

All the biopsies were performed with a guidance of ultrasound. The procedure, complications, histological diagnoses and impact of the biopsy data on patients' management were recorded. Thirty percent of the biopsies were performed in the first 12 months post-transplantation and 24% were performed after the 60 th month. Adequate biopsy was achieved in 76% of the patients, with a 96% safety rate. Acute rejection was diagnosed in 38% of the biopsies and chronic allograft nephropathy in 38%, and they were the most common histological patterns in the study. The results of allograft biopsies positively impacted the management strategy in all study groups. Renal allograft biopsy was a useful and a relatively safe tool for the diagnosis of acute and chronic graft dysfunction in our experience.},

Modeling the transmission range by a perfect circle around each transmitter is absolutely wrong especially in urban environments. In our previous work, we defined a terrain characteristics-based propagation model for vehicular network. This model determines the received signal power according to the type and the density of obstacles encountered by the radio waves. In this paper we calibrate the model parameters to meet the physical layer specifications of the standard dedicated to inter-vehicular communication, 802.11p. We validate the new values by several simulation tests. Based on this model, we present a study of the radio connectivity for a vehicular network in city environment and evaluate the impact of obstacles on information dissemination in such a network. The tests are performed by considering a simulation environment that represents a real city map. We define several metrics characterizing the radio connectivity and the information dissemination and examine the effect of vehicles density and obstacles on those metrics.},

   abstract = {During the past decades, the city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia has witnessed dramatic changes in its urban area, population and transportation. To better understand the relationship between urban growth and transportation, this paper aims to quantify and analyze the spatial-temporal relationship between urban growth and transportation for Jeddah using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches. In this paper, eight urban growth and transportation indices were developed to analyze the relationship between spatial-temporal urban growth and transportation changes: (1) annual urban spatial expansion index, (2) land use change index, (3) population density index, (4) transportation infrastructure expansion index, (5) road density index, (6) road area density index, (7) urban trips density index, and (8) modal split change index. The results show that in the past four decades (1964-2007), Jeddah has experienced a rapid population growth, a large spatial expansion, rapidly changing land use and expanding transportation infrastructure. As transportation infrastructure expands with population growth, this expansion has not been able to accommodate increases in travel demand. This has led to an increase in urban congestion. The analysis further shows that transportation infrastructure expansion has stimulated Jeddah's urban spatial expansion and residential area growth. The enormous spatial expansion has also caused significant changes in the daily share of travel modes. The developed indicators in the paper bridge the knowledge gap between urban growth and transportation research, as the results of this study provide a rich understanding of the relationship between urban growth and transportation in rapidly growing cities.

   abstract = {Understanding the interaction between urban land-use change and transport is critical for urban planning as well as for transport planning, particularly in the case of rapidly growing and motorising cities, such as Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. Dynamic land use and transport interaction models provide a good platform to study this mutual interaction. In this paper, we introduce one instance of these models, a cellular automata (CA)-based land-use/transport interaction model (LUTI), which was applied to the quickly growing metropolitan area of Jeddah. The model was calibrated using a stage-wise calibration and evaluated using an independent validation. The CA-based LUTI model outperforms a similar stand-alone CA-based model, which indicates that land use and transport interact and that models for understanding urban dynamics benefit from including the feedback between both systems. Such understanding facilitates the estimation of future dynamics of land-use change and transport in cities, and can support the development of alternative spatial plans and policies.

   abstract = {Crime is both a factual and perceptual component of the urban landscape, seemingly both a societal pathology and the consequence of economic disparity between social groups. Crime has a spatial structure that can be revealed by mapping. Urban crime has a spatial multiplier effect that changes the values and perceptions of how people see urban space, and which jeopardizes the quality of life of a city's inhabitants. In this research we examine the question of whether the geography of actual criminal acts is echoed by peoples' perceptions of crime, what might be termed their "spaces of fear". We ask how the fear of crime is associated with reported urban crime. Urban crime incidents have been increasing in Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We assembled crime information about Vicosa from two sources: first, crime as reported to the police and second, crime as perceived by city residents and measured by surveys and interviews. Reported criminal acts reveal a clustered geography, focusing particularly on the Downtown area, where there is a concentration of urban wealth and potential victims are more numerous. Offenses against property were focused on Downtown, while offenses against the person were located mostly in peripheral areas. The widespread feeling of insecurity in the city's neighborhoods, reflecting the fear of becoming a victim of violence and crime, was common throughout the city. Results confirmed the conclusion of past studies showing that the fear of violence and crime are not directly related to increasing numbers of criminal reports. Sites with higher incidence of crimes are not places with higher levels of fear. Rather than being geographically explainable "spaces of fear", the spatial distribution of the fear of violence and crime appears to be unrelated in Vicosa, and neither is clustered or dispersed in any measurable way.

The issue of urban protests, however, has not yet been investigated in detail in the light of the growing concern of the need to rethink urban studies, from theoretical and epistemic assumptions, to methodological issues. It is argued that the mobilisation of urban dissent in the so-called Arab Spring offers a good opportunity to develop a critical approach based on the observation of the nexus between an event (a punctual expression of dissent) and a site (the urban environment in which the former takes place). The goal is to avoid theoretical rigidities inherent to the assumptions about the intrinsic qualities of cities or social movements. The paper also aims at connecting different academic and disciplinary traditions across linguistic dividesand especially the Anglophone urban studies with the Francophone stream of city-focused political science and political sociology.},

However, little empirical data is available to inform dingo management or address potential dingo human conflicts during urban planning. From GPS tracking data, the nine dingoes, predominately juvenile and female, we tracked lived within 700 m of residential homes at all times and frequently crossed roads, visited backyards and traversed built-up areas. Home range sizes ranged between 0.37 km(2) and 100.32 km(2). Dingoes were mostly nocturnal, averaging 591 m/h between dusk and dawn. Juvenile and adult dingoes spent up to 19% and 72% of their time in urban habitats. Fresh scats from most areas surveyed tested positive to a variety of common zoonoses. These data suggest dingoes are capable of exploiting pen-urban areas and might contribute to human health and safety risks, the significance of which remains unknown. (C) 2013 The Authors.

In the UK, there have been calls to raise young people's aspirations for careers in the creative industries-identified as emblematic of the new economic order and a key growth sector. Yet, the sector is socially and spatially restricted, characterised by unclear entry routes, exclusionary working practices and uneven geographical concentration. This paper draws on research with young people (aged 14-16 years) living in three urban areas of deindustrialisation in England to examine the geography of young people's aspirations for careers in the creative industries. The concept of place-specific habitus is used to problematise asocial and aspatial discourses of aspiration and to illuminate how social class and place powerfully and complexly interrelate to shape young people's opportunities for social and geographical mobility through and for work in the knowledge economy.},

The majority of these dwellings are well recognized for their courtyard arrangement and perforated fenestration systems that evolved to control the harsh solar, climatic conditions without compromising the aesthetic quality of the space and the occupants' well-being. The unique visual characteristics of these structures cannot be fully appreciated by assessing the visual performance of buildings in isolation from their urban context. Much of the character of the traditional urban fabric of this region came from the collective visual perception of its architectural components as well as urban patterns. This paper examines daylight behavior of a well-known historic alleyway and of a courtyard house in the Old City of Cairo. Using the Radiance IES simulation modeling tool and a scaled model under an artificial sky dome, the paper investigates the visual comfort in a typical pedestrian street and a selected house. A comparative analysis between simulated results and measured values at target points was conducted. The results indicate a reasonable agreement with the simulation results. The paper gives an insight into the overall visual experience in the traditional settlements in the Old City of Cairo in relation to daylight components and hence their contribution to the unique sense of identity of the place.},

Climate change and increasing urbanization are expected to worsen this concern, with some locations being more vulnerable than others. The aim of this study was to determine the short-term effect of heat on mortality in the two most populated cities in Portugal: Lisbon and Oporto. Each city was assessed for specific heat stress threshold above which heat-related mortality becomes significant. A Poisson generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was used to estimate the impact of maximum apparent temperature (ATmax) and maximum temperature (Tmax) on daily mortality, in the summer season. Data show ATmax thresholds of 30.4 degrees C for Lisbon and 26.3 degrees C for Oporto, and Tmax thresholds of 29.3 degrees C and 25.0 degrees C, respectively. For every 1 degrees C elevation in ATmax above the city-specific threshold, all-cause mortality rate rose by 7.13% (95% CI: 5.9; 8.4) in Lisbon and 4.31% (95% CI: 3.2; 5.4) in Oporto. The Tmax threshold increases were 5.6% (95% CI: 4.6; 6.6) in Lisbon and 3% (95% CI: 2.0, 3.9) in Oporto. In both cities, stronger associations were found for respiratory diseases and the elderly group was the most vulnerable. This study confirmed that elevated temperatures have a considerable impact on daily mortality frequency in the two most urbanized areas in Portugal. Our results also provide useful data for policymakers to better prepare local actions to mitigate and reduce the health risks associated with high temperatures.},

   abstract = {Heat stress is a current public health concern during the warm months in many urban areas. Climate change and increasing urbanization are expected to worsen this concern, with some locations being more vulnerable than others. The aim of this study was to determine the short-term effect of heat on mortality in the two most populated cities in Portugal: Lisbon and Oporto. Each city was assessed for specific heat stress threshold above which heat-related mortality becomes significant. A Poisson generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was used to estimate the impact of maximum apparent temperature (ATmax) and maximum temperature (Tmax) on daily mortality, in the summer season. Data show ATmax thresholds of 30.4 degrees C for Lisbon and 26.3 degrees C for Oporto, and Tmax thresholds of 29.3 degrees C and 25.0 degrees C, respectively.

   abstract = {Hanoverian London was a city full of people, a city built by people for people. These impressions dominate traditional studies of the metropolis to a remarkable extent. By contrast, historians have largely overlooked the ubiquitous presence of non-human animals in the city and underestimate their impact on urban life. This article challenges key assumptions about the Hanoverian metropolis by highlighting the role of its quadruped architects, and specifically its working horses. In doing so, it urges the recognition of animals as influential actors in social, urban and economic history. The article focuses on the role of the horse in brewing, a major metropolitan industry which relied heavily on equine power. Crucially, it shows that the brewery horse became more, rather than less, influential during the industrial revolution.},

   abstract = {The concept of smart city has emerged worldwide as a feasible answer to the challenges raised by the increasing urbanisation. From the technological point of view, guaranteeing ubiquitous connectivity, reliable communications and seamless integration of multiple network access technologies are mandatory in a smart city. This is in contrast with the current infrastructure deployment in several urban areas, which is characterised by lack of ubiquitous connectivity and coverage and by fragmentation of networks that are usually deployed by different operators and without any centralised control by the city authorities. In this paper, we look at the heterogeneity of devices and network technologies under a different perspective by not perceiving it as a limitation but as a potential to increase the connectivity in a smart city. We propose a new generation of network nodes, called stem nodes, based on the innovative idea of stemness', which pushes forward the well-known self-configuration and self-management concepts towards the idea of node mutation and evolution. We also deployed prototypes that demonstrate the stem-node architecture and basic operations in different hardware platforms of common communication devices (an Alix-based router, a laptop and a smartphone).

Nowadays children and adolescents are legally considered subjects who hold rights and who are in a peculiar development. Considering the bioecological theory as a theoretical reference, this study aims at understanding the perception of adolescents from urban and rural contexts about children and adolescents' rights. The subjects of the study were 47 adolescents of both genders, between 12 and 15 years old, from which 20 were elementary school students in the urban and 27 in the rural areas of an inner-city of RS. The questionnaire on the knowledge of rights was applied and analyzed quantitatively based on descriptive statistics and qualitatively, using content analysis. Adolescents from both contexts showed knowledge about some basic rights of children and adolescents, as the right of not working, of not being apart from their families and of having their opinions taken into account. Among the participants' perceptions we noticed conceptions socially shared over the centuries, such as the approval of physical punishment and poverty as a reason for being separated from their families. Thus, more discussions are necessary to announce the current laws, besides problematizing the rooted cultural conceptions.

   abstract = {This article proposes a methodology to address the urban evolutionary process, demonstrating how it is reflected in literature. It focuses on "literary space," presented as a territory defined by the period setting or as evoked by the characters, which can be georeferenced and drawn on a map. It identifies the different locations of literary space in relation to urban development and the economic, political, and social context of the city. We suggest a new approach for mapping a relatively comprehensive body of literature by combining literary criticism, urban history, and geographic information systems (GIS). The home-range concept, used in animal ecology, has been adapted to reveal the size and location of literary space. This interdisciplinary methodology is applied in a case study to nineteenth- and twentieth-century novels involving the city of Lisbon. The developing concepts of cumulative literary space and common literary space introduce size calculations in addition to location and structure, previously developed by other researchers. Sequential and overlapping analyses of literary space throughout time have the advantage of presenting comparable and repeatable results for other researchers using a different body of literary works or studying another city. Results show how city changes shaped perceptions of the urban space as it was lived and experienced. A small core area, correspondent to a part of the city center, persists as literary space in all the novels analyzed. Furthermore, the literary space does not match the urban evolution. There is a time lag for embedding new urbanized areas in the imagined literary scenario.},

   abstract = {We report on a quantitative analysis of relationships between the number of homicides, population size and ten other urban metrics. By using data from Brazilian cities, we show that well-defined average scaling laws with the population size emerge when investigating the relations between population and number of homicides as well as population and urban metrics. We also show that the fluctuations around the scaling laws are log-normally distributed, which enabled us to model these scaling laws by a stochastic-like equation driven by a multiplicative and log-normally distributed noise. Because of the scaling laws, we argue that it is better to employ logarithms in order to describe the number of homicides in function of the urban metrics via regression analysis. In addition to the regression analysis, we propose an approach to correlate crime and urban metrics via the evaluation of the distance between the actual value of the number of homicides ( as well as the value of the urban metrics) and the value that is expected by the scaling law with the population size. This approach has proved to be robust and useful for unveiling relationships/behaviors that were not properly carried out by the regression analysis, such as i) the non-explanatory potential of the elderly population when the number of homicides is much above or much below the scaling law, ii) the fact that unemployment has explanatory potential only when the number of homicides is considerably larger than the expected by the power law, and iii) a gender difference in number of homicides, where cities with female population below the scaling law are characterized by a number of homicides above the power law.},

It enables new applications running on mobile phones and desktops. It allows users to share music and information about music they listened to in different locations. With SoundAbout people can experience music related to the different locations in various ways, for instance by seeing what music has been listened in different districts of the city during a particular time span, select a list of favourite artists or songs and attach that list in favourable location, and see who else in different locations share their taste in music. Our goal is to not only support musical serendipity, but also affect the city culture. With context-aware music services, it is possible to offer people new kinds of urban audio experiences. In this paper, we apply characteristics of psychogeography and graffiti painting as an inspiration for the design of service concepts for the platform.},

The data resulting from a series of investigations for the design of infrastructures allowed to re-elaborate the complex paleomorfology of the area and New reconstractions thesis, thus affecting the succession of natural processes and human activities which have profoundly changed the coastal area of Pozzuoli from ancient times to the present. It is shown that bradyseismic processes were already active in The Roman Republican Age and probably influenced the urban expansion, having an impact on the various the various stages of development and restoration of the city. On the basis of reported data, a reconstruction is proposed by the uplift and downward distortion of the ground surface during the centuries, with particular reference to the Macellum, that has been often used as a "marker" for the reconstruction of the movements of the Phlegraean area. In addition, and specifically the analysis of the materials of the old port quays confirm the indications reported by Vitruvius (De Architectura, V, XII), which was the only literary source on the construction of harbours in ancient times.},

Evidence also indicates that returnees to metropolitan regions are more likely to stay permanently than are migrants returning elsewhere. Furthermore, return migrants to metropolitan regions are distinguished from other return migrants in ways that emphasize the advantages of these regions, higher incomes and levels of education being among the pronounced attributes. However, metro-bound returnees do not have as many children as do other return migrants.},

Rather than focusing on the well-known military provenance of AMM, this article shifts attention to how the work expresses politically specific ideas about the importance of the individual in human-computer interaction and how ArcMac formulated these ideas in response to the discourses of urban crisis and techno-paranoia circulating during the 1970s. The city in crisis provided a convenient metaphor for the staging of ideas about how human-computer interaction could dramatically extend the power of individuals to create and govern their own worlds without the assistance of any intervening social institution or government body.},

   abstract = {Rapid urbanization globally threatens to increase the risk to mental health and requires a rethinking of the relationship between urban poverty and mental health. The aim of this article is to reveal the cyclic nature of this relationship: Concentrated urban poverty cultivates mental illness, while the resulting mental illness reinforces poverty. The authors used theories about social disorganization and crime to explore the mechanisms through which the urban environment can contribute to mental health problems. They present some data on crime, substance abuse, and social control to support their claim that mental illness reinforces poverty. The authors argue that, to interrupt this cycle and improve outcomes, social workers and policymakers must work together to implement a comprehensive mental health care system that emphasizes prevention, reaches young people, crosses traditional health care provision boundaries, and involves the entire community to break this cycle and improve the outcomes of those living in urban poverty.},

Drawing on two years of ethnographic research in Mumbai, in this article I show how Muslim settlers in a northern suburb, are being rendered abject residents of the city. Abjection isn't not a lack of social and political entitlements, but a denial of them. As Muslim settlers are being pushed down to claim less desirable water through the deliberate inaction of city engineers and technocrats, this article shows the iterative process through which abjection is made through tenuous and contentious infrastructural connections between the government and the governed.},

   abstract = {City logistics is a discipline specialized to cope with the sustainability problems encountered in urban freight transport. A key characteristic of it is the heterogeneity of the stakeholders involved. Besides the traditional logistics actors such as shippers, carriers and receivers that share consistent interests (i.e. price and quality), city logistics highly respect the interests of public administrators and citizens that care more about the social welfare. To reach an optimal balance between private and public benefit, it is necessary to understand and in turn forecast the behavior pattern of different groups. In recent years, agent-based modeling has been practiced as an unconventional tool to fulfill this task for its strong capability on capturing the dynamic behavior of individual stakeholders and their interconnections. Referring to other domains (e.g. energy system) where the application of agent-based modeling is relatively mature, a following urgency is to achieve interoperability and in turn reusability between models via introducing formal ontology as a shared template with which developers can standardize their models. This paper introduces an initiative of developing an ontology that formalizes the domain knowledge of city logistics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Globalization and economic liberalization are enabling individuals in emerging economies like India to access lifestyles similar to the resource-intense West. This spread of consumerism poses substantial ecological challenges, and calls for studies that investigate the environmental values, ethics, and politics of India's new consumers. In this paper, I explore emerging pro-environmental behaviors in the city of Bangalore, India, among the new middle classes- its most significant consumer class. Using the case of home waste management, I show how household behavior change is made possible by neighborhood-based coordination, involving multiple actors such as environmentally-conscious residents, domestic help, and hired waste workers. Drawing on ecological citizenship theory, I discuss how waste management through recycling and composting is being implemented in Bangalore through networks of socio-economically privileged new middle class individuals. Their privileged social, political, and economic positions enable them to collectively enact changes in their cultural and structural contexts to facilitate pro-environmental initiatives. At the same time, the role of other actors like domestic servants and waste workers is also critical to the process. I show how ecological citizenship theory can be used to analyze and highlight voluntary involvement by socio-economically privileged individuals but fails to recognize the contributions of actors, who through their livelihood practices, play a pivotal role in producing the systems that enable pro-environmental behaviors among the elite. I conclude by suggesting that a critical analysis of the processes and political arrangements that produce pro-environmental behaviors is vital to sustainable consumption and production research in emerging economies like India.

   abstract = {How can fiscal and density-zoning instruments help finance local public goods, while mitigating congestion in a general equilibrium system of cities? The literature-based on the model of a single monocentric city with congestion but no public good-shows core densities increasing and total land area decreasing if Pigouvian tolls or urban growth boundaries (UGBs) are used. In the utility-improving regimes of our setup, including tolls or the UGB, core densities are lowered in each city but more and smaller cities emerge at long-run equilibrium. If lot size and other goods are sufficiently complementary in consumption, it is optimal that total land area increases in the aggregate even as congestion tolls or the UGB decrease the total area of each city. Density zoning is either redundant or achieves first-best efficiency depending on the fiscal instruments present.},

The findings suggest this drift-film strategy can be successful in sensitizing individuals to the benefits of qualitative methods, can enhance students' ability to story-board and structure their arguments, and develop key editing skills which can be transferred to future employability.},

   abstract = {Objectives. To compare the incidence of renal ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) in urban vs more rural populations in northern Saskatchewan, and as a secondary objective to compare time to diagnosis between these geographic areas. Methods. Northern Saskatchewan has a population of 562 882 of which approximately 260 600 live in the major urban area. A pathology database search for renal biopsy reports suggestive of AAV between January 2007 and December 2011 and subsequent chart review yielded 33 new diagnoses of granulomatosis polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Data extraction included demographics, residential data, serological status, recorded symptom onset and estimations of BVAS, five-factor score (FFS) and vasculitis damage index (VDI). Results. Of 33 renal AAV cases, 24.2% (n = 8) lived within the city. The incidence rate for urban residents was 6.1 cases/million/year, and for those residing elsewhere, 16.5 cases/million/year. The odds ratio for the more rural population was 2.69 (95% CI 1.3, 7.5). Mean time to diagnosis was 1.33 (S. D. 0.94) months for urban and 3.52 (S. D. 3.83) months for more rural patients (P = 0.002, 95% CI 0.7, 3.9). Secondary analysis supported these observations with higher BVAS, VDI and FFS scores in patients living outside the urban centre. Conclusion. The incidence of renal biopsy-proven AAV was higher in patients living in northern Saskatchewan smaller communities and rural settings. A significantly longer time to diagnosis existed for patients outside the urban centre and was associated with poorer BVAS, VDI and FFS scores.},

This study, alternatively, reveals these formations as adroitly proactive and interactively heterogeneous across their respective cities. Through a racial economy lens, we empirically examine the racial contours of this "governance heterogeneity" in one urban setting: Chicago, Illinois. In this frame, a comparative analysis of Chicago's Bronzeville and Pilsen neighborhoods is presented. Both neighborhoods are constituted by different racial profiles: Bronzeville is home to a predominantly African-American population, whereas Pilsen is mostly Mexican and Mexican-American. The study reveals that redevelopment governances are differentially responsive to established, deeply rooted racialized conceptions of "Blackness" and "Latinoness." As a result, the form and trajectory of redevelopment in both settings has unfolded in markedly different ways.},

   abstract = {Calls for greater engagement between academia and society to address mounting societal problems persist. The African Centre for Cities, a University of Cape Town research entity, set up the CityLab programme to broker interdisciplinary engagement, both across academic disciplines and between academia and broader society, to engage with the issues pertinent to sustainable urban development in Cape Town. CityLabs were formed around specific themes and sought to share and co-produce knowledge. Reflections on the running of six distinct CityLabs within this innovative programme over the first 2 years corroborate views emerging in the literature around the outcomes of, and challenges to, interdisciplinary work. The creation of productive and engaged communities, emerging publications and the professional growth and development of researchers heading up the CityLabs stand testimony to the success of the programme. Challenges include issues around micro-politics, getting people to move out of their disciplinary and practice biases, the difficulties of writing and producing knowledge in interdisciplinary groups, and the fact that this type of work takes longer than standard research work. Reflections suggest that the personal biography of the research leader of each CityLab, the role of funders, the history of the discipline in question, and the actual space in which meetings are held are significant influencing factors in determining how interdisciplinary work plays out.

Data on the schools attended by history students at Edinburgh University between 1899 and 1933 illustrate the diversity and social ranking of schools in the city. New higher grade schools had a key role in increasing access to university education for both men and women, especially for prospective teachers; the significance of the Education (Scotland) Act of 1918 for Catholic schools, and the continuing importance of small private schools for girls, are also shown. The second source analyses the school origins of successful Edinburgh candidates in civil service examinations between 1896 and 1944, supplemented for other parts of Scotland by the report of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service of 1912. This elite career drew mainly from older schools, and contemporary claims for equality of opportunity in Scotland need to be treated with reserve.},
